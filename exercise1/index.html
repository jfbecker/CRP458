<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there,
  
  My name is Jason Becker and I am a senior in Community and Regional Planning. I will be on campus this semester. I am working towards a GIS minor and have recently taken a class regarding programming and automation with GIS. That course introduced me to coding, but mainly focused on coding in the python language. I have no experience with HTML or JavaScript, but I am familiar with standard coding practices. I hope to further familiarize myself in coding and learn different languages and how they interact and improve GIS projects.</p>
